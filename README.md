# Multilingual Children's (online) library - SIDE PROJECT
## ProOktatas Full-stack Developer bootcamp - BACKEND MODULE

### **_Introduction_**
During the 3 months Backend module, I have learned the basics PHP and MySQL. Unfortunately I was little short of practice and motivation, therefore I decided to start already with a "exam"-project middle of the course. (I got to know that this time we cannot choose our own exam project, so this project became a side-project)

In this exam project, there were some requirements. The project needed to be a CRUD app with a database connection. 

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. Tailwind Css and Tailwind Elements
2. VueJS
3. PHP
4. MySQL

## **_The project itself_**
I'm building an online library for children. As someone from a multilingual family, I know how important it is for children to learn their mother tongue in an environment where the language is different. That's why I'm creating a library management system where visitors can browse children's books in different languages and age groups. Users can borrow books and have them shipped directly to their address. They have to return the book to the online library address within three weeks, or a fee will be charged.

**Aim of the Project**

To make a simple CRUD application where the user can browse, book and return a book. On the admin side it is possible to add, modify and delete data.


## **_What have I learned_**

## Deployed: coming soon.
