# Multilingual Children's (online) library - SIDE PROJECT
## ProOktatas Full-stack Developer bootcamp - BACKEND MODULE

### **_Introduction_**
During the 3 months Backend module, I have learned the basics PHP and MySQL. Unfortunately I was little short of practice and motivation, therefore I decided to start already with a "exam"-project middle of the course. (I got to know that this time we cannot choose our own exam project, so this project became a side-project)

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. Tailwind Css and Tailwind Elements
2. VueJS
3. PHP
4. MySQL

## **_The project itself_**
As someone from a multilingual family, I know how important it is for children to learn their mother tongue in an environment where the language is different. That's why I'm creating a library management system where visitors can browse children's books in different languages and age groups. Users can borrow books and have them shipped directly to their address. They have to return the book to the online library address within three weeks, or a fee will be charged.

**Aim of the Project**

The main objective of this project is to create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that enables users to browse, borrow, and return books. The admin side allows for the addition, modification, and deletion of data. Upon registration, users receive an activation code via email (which may end up in the spam folder) or can use 00000000 as their activation code. After logging in, users can view their borrowed books and request additional books. On the admin page, the admin can add new categories, authors, books, etc. or disable them (making them inactive and unable to be borrowed). If a book is returned, the admin can register the return. If the return date has passed, the user is required to pay a fee, and their borrowing privileges are temporarily suspended until payment is made.

**Challenges within the project**
* I am working on a linux therefore setting up apache server and its configuration was pretty interesting...
* CORS was something I have struggled as the backend and vue frontend was running on different port locally. During deployment I again encountered with this problem. 
* Writing code in different programming languages in the same time. So many times I started to write JS code in PHP and vice versa... :D 

## **_What have I learned_**
